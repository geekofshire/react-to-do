# To-do App

[Demo Link](https://react-to-do-blush.vercel.app/)

This is a simple To-do app built using basic React concepts. The app allows users to add tasks, remove tasks, edit tasks, and mark tasks as done.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can add a new task by entering it into the input field and pressing Enter or clicking the "Add" button.

- **Remove Task**: Each task has a "Remove" button associated with it, allowing users to delete tasks they no longer need.

- **Edit Task**: Users can edit a task by clicking on the task text itself. This will convert the task text into an editable input field where users can modify the task. Pressing Enter or clicking outside the input field will save the changes.

- **Mark Task as Done**: Tasks can be marked as done by clicking on the checkbox next to the task. This will toggle the task between a completed and uncompleted state.
